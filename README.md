# Food Ordering Chatbot

We have built a functional chatbot interface using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The chatbot can interact with users, ask questions, display messages, and respond with precision. The assignment was done in pairs/small groups.

## The problem

We bulit a chain of messages, that passes information through arguments. A setTimeout function is then used to trigger the next message to appear on screen.
The chatbot provides the user with food options in the form of buttons. Based on the users answer it is then provided with different subtype options. We did this using if-statements.

To make the insert field transform into buttons, we used DOM-selectors and event listeners.

We focused on trying to fully understand what the code means, making sure everybody follows before we went forward to then next task. 
If we had more time we would have like to try implementing a drop down menu and a button to start the conversation. Focus more on styling and trying out animations and sound effects.
